# E-Commerce Brogrammers Mall

To access BrogrammersMall deployed application, visit https://brogrammersmall.netlify.app/

E-Commercy Brogrammers Mall is an e-commerce web application built using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/). The project is being developed by a Fall team, which means it is expected to be completed by the end of the Fall semester.

The goal of the project is to create a fully functional online mall where users can browse and purchase a wide variety of products. The mall will have multiple stores, each selling different types of products, such as clothing, electronics, and home goods. Users will be able to create accounts, add items to their shopping cart, and make payments securely through the site.

The E-Commercy Brogrammers Mall project will use [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. ReactJS will allow for efficient rendering of the interface, while Redux will be used to manage the state of the application. The team will also use other technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the application.

The team will follow Agile development practices, with regular sprints and stand-up meetings to track progress and ensure that the project stays on schedule. The team will also use version control software such as Git to manage code changes and collaborate effectively.

Overall, the E-Commercy Brogrammers Mall project aims to create a robust and scalable e-commerce platform that provides a seamless shopping experience for users.
